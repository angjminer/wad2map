This program converts Doom levels from WAD files into Quake .map files (which need to be further compiled to actually be played in the Quake engine).

This is some really old code I wrote back in 1999. I've fixed a few things so that it compiles with modern clang on OS X, and it looks like it still works, but YMMV.
